# Heart Attack Dataset Analysis: Insights on Youth and Adult Health in Germany

## Overview

This dataset provides valuable insights into the occurrence of heart attacks among individuals under 25 years (youth) and those 25 years and older (adults) across various states in Germany from 2015 to 2023. The data includes several health and lifestyle factors, such as hypertension, BMI (Body Mass Index), and socioeconomic status. The dataset is designed to encourage deeper exploration by being unevenly distributed, making the analysis more challenging and rewarding.

By analyzing this dataset, we aim to understand the factors contributing to heart attacks and uncover patterns that might be used for preventive measures.
